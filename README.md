# d3.js Scripts

## :woman_student: I am teaching myself d3... 
Yes, that's right. I am currently following Amelia Wattenberg's [*Fullstack D3 and Data Visualization: Build Beautiful Data Visualizations with D3*](https://www.amazon.com/Fullstack-Data-Visualization-beautiful-visualizations/dp/0991344650#:~:text=Fullstack%20D3%20and%20Data%20Visualization,9780991344659%3A%20Amazon.com%3A%20Books). I am recycling the code in the book and using the [*Human Freedom Index*](https://www.cato.org/human-freedom-index/2021) data to build my own charts and experiment with other types of charts, as well as colors, styles, etc. I will also be experimenting with simpler d3 examples that do not require big datasets (e.g. event listeners like `mouseenter` or `mouseout` on simple shapes).

## :octocat: Repo Content
This repo includes:
* `all_countries.csv`: *Human Freedom Index* data
* `dataFile.py`: Python script for slicing/exporting the data according to charts needs
* `/histograms`: histograms with `d3.transition()`
